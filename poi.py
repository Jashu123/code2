I'll modify the report to include both the total occurrences of LTSSM state changes in the minute of interest, and the number of occurrences within the exact same second (which can indicate suspicious patterns):

This version:

1. Counts total LTSSM state changes at each timestamp as before
2. Also groups events by exact second within each minute
3. Identifies "suspicious" seconds that have multiple LTSSM state changes
4. Reports both the total count and the suspicious second count for each timestamp
5. Provides an overall summary that includes:
   - Total timestamps with LTSSM changes
   - Total LTSSM changes found
   - Total number of suspicious seconds with multiple changes
6. Adds a single concise entry to the report table with the essential information

This gives you both types of information:
- How many LTSSM events occurred in the minute of interest
- How many suspicious seconds within that minute had multiple LTSSM changes in the exact same second

The suspicious second count is particularly useful because multiple LTSSM state changes occurring in the exact same second can indicate PCIe link stability issues, which may correlate with the host errors.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
