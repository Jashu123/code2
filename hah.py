Here's a simple script that performs the NVMe Identify Controller command similar to what was failing in your test framework. This script focuses specifically on that command for diagnostic purposes:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Simple NVMe Identify Controller command test script.

This script attempts to perform a basic NVMe Identify Controller command,
which is what was failing in the original test. It can be used to diagnose
device responsiveness issues.

This script:

1. Attempts to execute the same NVMe Identify Controller command that was failing
2. Tries multiple approaches with different parameters/timeouts
3. Provides detailed logging of success or failure at each step
4. Includes a low-level approach that gives more diagnostic information

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `simple_identify_test.py`)
2. Run it through your test framework in the same way you would run your other tests
3. The output will help diagnose if the device is still having the same unresponsive issues

This focused approach will help determine if the device is consistently having problems with this specific command or if the issue was temporary/intermittent.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
