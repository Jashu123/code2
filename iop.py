This implementation:

1. Attempts to extract the exact second from the host log timestamp
2. Groups LTSSM events by their seconds
3. For each second with LTSSM changes, calculates a "proximity percentage" to the host error second:
   - 100% = exact same second as the host error
   - 0% = furthest possible distance (30 seconds away)
   - Values in between represent how close the second is to the host error second

For example, if the host error occurred at second :22, then:
- LTSSM changes at second :22 would have 100% proximity
- LTSSM changes at second :21 or :23 would have ~97% proximity
- LTSSM changes at second :15 would have ~77% proximity
- LTSSM changes at second :00 would have ~27% proximity

This gives you a simple percentage value that indicates how close each group of LTSSM changes is to the exact second of the host error.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
